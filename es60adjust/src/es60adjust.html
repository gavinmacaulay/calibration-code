<h1>1. ES60 triangle wave removal</h1>
<h2>1.1 Overview</h2>
<p>This program removes the
"triangle wave" error added to Simrad ES60 data. This error has a
triangle wave pattern with peak to peak value of 1 dB and period of
2721 pings This program has two main functions. Firstly it provides
tools to assist the user in establishing where the error on the
first ping is at in relation to the 2721 ping error cycle. Secondly
with the location in the error sequence established, the program
can then progress through each ping, adding a value equal to the
mirror image of the triangle wave error. The output is written to a
new file. Note: The program can correct for multiple continuous
files but any breaks in logging or sounder resets will break the
pattern of the error, so each group must be run through the program
seperately.<br>
</p>
<h2>1.2 Basic Operation</h2>
<p>Running the program requires
four steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>select input files</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>specify the ping number of the
first ping</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>specify the output files</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>run</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Select files</h4>
<p>Use the <code>Add</code> button to select the group
of files to process. You can use the <code>Up</code> and <code>Down</code> buttons to ensure files are in the correct
order (order does matter).</p>
<h4>Enter ping number</h4>
<p>Enter the ping number for the
first ping in the first data file. See Section 1.3 for Help for
determining the ping number can be found below.</p>
<h4>Specify output files</h4>
<p>Select the output directory and
filename affix for the output files. The filename affix
"<code>Append to
filename</code>" is added to the name of each file
immediately prior to the <code>.raw</code> extension. The affix may be left blank if
the input and output directories are different. Use of an affix is
strongly recommended unless you have really good procedures in
place for keeping track of what files have undergone what
processing.</p>
<h4>Run</h4>
<p>Click on the <code>Run</code> button to process the data.
The program will process all the data files in the input, in the
order given, with the ping number carrying over from one file to
the next. Any selection (highlighting) of files is ignored.</p>
<h2>1.3 Finding the first ping</h2>
<p>Identifying the ping number of
the first ping in the series of files is the most difficult step,
and not easily automated. The program does provide a variety of
tools to help in this process. These tools are accessed via the
<code>Info</code> button.<br>
The tools can be used in a variety of ways as detailed below, from
simplest to most complicated.</p>
<h4>Accepting the program's guess</h4>
<p>The program uses a set of
defaults to come up with a best guess of the first ping number.
This is calculated separately for each data channel.<br>
Where the program came up with a guess, a button containing the
ping number is included near the middle of the Info displayed.
Click on this button to copy this number to the <code>First ping number</code> field in the
main window.</p>
<h4>Selecting the minimum or maximum
value graphically</h4>
<p>A small plot of the first 2721
pings is displayed for each data channel. Clicking on this plot
will bring it up in a larger size.<br>
The plot contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Blue points representing the
sample value for that ping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A black horizontal line through
zero</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A red wave line shows the
program's best guess of the triangle wave.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Black vertical lines mark the
maximum, minimum and zero points of the best guess.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A red vertical line denotes the
end of the first data file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Often it will be straightforward
to visually identify the maximum and minimum points of the triangle
wave. If so, click on the maximum or minimum points of the wave
(above the zero line for maximum, below the zero line for minimum).
The first ping number corresponding to that max/min will appear in
a button in the lower right corner. Click on the button to copy
this number to the <code>First ping
number</code> field in the main window.</p>
<h4>Other searches</h4>
<p>You can change the parameters
used to search for the first ping and click on the search button. A
new search result will appear in the middle of the window
(including plot) and you may use its results as above. The search
parameters, roughly in order of usefulness, are:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td>
<p>Search parameters</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>First sample</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Select the start of the range of
samples to look at. Usually 0.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Last sample</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Normally the ES60 has a ring down
in the first few samples before any real data appears. This section
of the data is the best to use to attempt to locate the triangle
wave as it is normally clearly visible on top of a constant value.
The length of this ring down may vary between instruments but is
frequently 4 samples. If the data is noisy try reducing this value.
If the data is still noisy when this value is 1 you may need to try
using a large block to try and average out the noise (good luck,
you'll need it)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Average window</p>

<td>
<p>Number of pings to average over, to
try and average out noise. Default 1.</p>

value of a sum of n models centered on this model. Used to reject
insignificant outliers near the real minimum. Default 5.</p>

<tr>
<td>
<p>Pings</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Number of pings to include in
search. This must be greater than 1360 (half wave) to get a
meaningful result. Default 2721 (full wave).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Skip pings</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Ignore the first n pings. When the
ES60 is first powered up the initial pings often have lower sample
strength while the electronics warms up, this allows you to skip
those pings (but in that case the first ping number is 0
anyway).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Algorithm</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Weighting applied to deviations
from modelled values to find minimum difference. Square uses least
squares. This setting doesn't seem to make much difference, but it
hasn't been removed yet. Default Linear.</p>
